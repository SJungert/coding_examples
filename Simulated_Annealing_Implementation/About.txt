Contained in this directory: 
input.txt --- Contains area and aspect ratio for each Non Polish Expression (NPE)
Simulated_Annealing.h, Simulated_Annealing.cpp, and Main.cpp --- Contains varius functions
to calculate the minimum weight (minimum area) of a valid NPE. 
simulatedAnnealing.jpg --- Resultant NPE and area.

Functional Description (What does it do?):
Using simmulated annealing algorithm, the lowest cost (smallest area) NPE is calculated.
VLSI design and is an approach to floorplanning.
